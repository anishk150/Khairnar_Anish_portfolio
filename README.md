## Home Credit Deafult Risk (Kaggle Project)
Home Credit Group is dedicated to promoting financial inclusion for individuals without access to traditional banking services, by offering secure and beneficial borrowing opportunities. They use alternative data, such as telecom and transactional information, to forecast repayment capabilities and enhance loan accessibility. In order to advance this objective, Home Credit is inviting people to participte in Kaggle for enhancing their data utilization, guaranteeing that loans are provided in a manner that empowers clients and contributes to their financial prosperity.

## Data Provided
The dataset provided by [Home Credit](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview) includes a variety of alternative data sources, including telecommunications and transaction records, in addition to traditional financial data. This extensive dataset has been created to empower participants in building reliable models that can accurately predict the repayment capabilities of borrowers. The data includes a range of features such as demographic information, loan history, payment records, and social and economic variables.

## Business Problem & Purpose of Notebook
The main goal of this project is to enhance Home Credit's effectiveness by improving data analysis techniques and using advanced algorithms to identify potential borrowers who are likely to repay their loans responsibly. This approach aims to minimize unjustified loan rejections, enhance the precision of loan evaluations, and provide credit to deserving borrowers. Through the integration of advanced analytics, this project aims to create a precise predictive model that utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to make accurate loan repayment predictions.

The goal of this notebook is to create a predictive model that outperforms existing benchmarks. It tackles the pressing business challenge that Home Credit is confronted with: offering financial services to individuals who have limited or no credit history. The model is created to improve the loan approval process by accurately identifying applicants who have a higher probability of repaying loans. This helps to promote financial inclusion, minimize improper loan rejections, and reduce incorrect denials.

## Group's Solution to the Business Problem
In order to tackle the issue presented by Home Credit, our team has come up with a solution that utilizes cutting-edge machine learning models. This solution aims to improve the accuracy of loan approvals and reduce the number of defaults. We utilized a combination of Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) each selected for their unique abilities in managing various datasets and providing accurate predictions. 

When it came to meeting Home Credit's requirement for precise loan repayment predictions, our team looked into multiple modeling techniques, each resulting in different levels of success. The Logistic Regression model initially demonstrated limited predictive ability with an AUC-ROC of only 0.4464. However, there was a slight improvement to 0.5 after implementing data normalization. The performance of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was further enhanced, resulting in an AUC-ROC of 0.625. On the other hand, the Random Forest model showed better performance compared to all logistic regression variants, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.7088. This suggests that it has superior abilities in differentiating between classes. In addition, we conducted experiments with XGBoost, implementing various sampling techniques. The upsampled (SMOTE) XGBoost model achieved the highest Kaggle score of 0.51136 among our trials, indicating strong generalization to new data. Based on our thorough evaluation, we suggest using the upsampled XGBoost model for Home Credit. This model offers a strong balance between accuracy and generalizability, making it a powerful tool for predicting loan repayment likelihood. The predictive models underwent thorough validation through cross-validation to ensure their reliability and applicability to various segments.

## Your contribution to the project
In our Home Credit challenge project, I lead the introduction and created analytical framework and objectives. I used data visualization to reveal insights-generating patterns. I improved prediction accuracy by developing and comparing Logistic Regression models before and after data normalization. Additionally, I optimized a Random Forest model to greatly increase our predictions. 

## Business value of the solution
Our predictive modeling solution, specifically the upsampled XGBoost model, greatly enhances Home Credit's operational efficiency and financial stability by increasing the accuracy of loan repayment predictions. This enables a more secure expansion of credit to underserved populations, improving financial inclusion and expanding market reach. The decrease in default rates and the optimized loan processing also help to lower operational costs and improve customer satisfaction. In the end, our solution aligns with Home Credit's strategic objectives of inclusivity and growth, while also promoting lasting customer loyalty and a strong financial portfolio.

## Difficulties that your group encountered along the way
Throughout the project, our group encountered numerous significant obstacles that put our analytical and problem-solving abilities to the test. Class imbalance is a significant concern in predictive modeling as it can result in biased outcomes that favor the majority class. We tackled this issue by conducting experiments using different sampling strategies, like SMOTE, to guarantee that our models were both precise and impartial. Dealing with missing values was a challenge because our dataset had a lot of incomplete information. We had to use imputation techniques to fill in the median for numerical variable and mode for the categorical variable without affecting the accuracy of our analysis. Challenges emerged during the merging of multiple data sources, requiring careful alignment to establish a unified data framework for analysis due to inconsistencies and discrepancies between datasets. In addition, the evaluation of models posed challenges, especially when it came to accurately validating and interpreting their performance in a consistent manner.


## Learning Outcomes
Working on this project has been an incredibly rewarding experience, greatly expanding my knowledge and expertise in various aspects of data science. Firstly, addressing the concerns regarding missing data and class imbalance provided valuable insights into advanced data preprocessing techniques and emphasized the significance of ensuring data quality prior to model training. This played a crucial role in grasping the direct influence of data integrity on the results of predictive models. In addition, the task of combining various data sources emphasized the crucial significance of maintaining data consistency.

By utilizing different modeling approaches, I was able to gain practical experience with advanced machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. This not only enhanced my technical skills in implementing and fine-tuning these models, but also deepened my understanding of the variations in how they process data and generate predictions. 

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of financial data, specifically in the operations of credit score systems. Working with the complicated financial datasets, like the ones provided by Home Credit, has given me a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in credit risk assessment. I gained knowledge about various types of financial data, such as transactional and behavioral data, and their significance in predicting customer behavior, which is crucial in the credit industry.

This project highlighted the importance of collaboration in data science. By working closely with my peers, I gained valuable insights from their diverse perspectives and expertise. This collaboration proved essential in overcoming the challenges we encountered and successfully delivering a strong solution that met the project's objectives.
